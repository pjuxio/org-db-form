This launch aimed to bring greater visibility to the environmental challenges faced by Afro-descendant communities and their contributions to ecosystem stewardship (AIFCC n.d.). Participation in COP27: At COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, the AIFCC convened leaders from across the Americas to discuss the climate contributions of Afro-descendant territories. This event highlighted the significant overlap between biodiversity hotspots and areas with high Afro-descendant populations (ibid). The forum presented research estimating that over 178 million individuals identity as Afrodescendants in the Americas, emphasizing the important of their role in climate action (ibid). Advocacy and Awareness Building: The AIFCC has been actively involved in international forums such as the UN climate change and biodiversity summits, to advocate for the inclusion of Afrodescendant perspectives in climate policies (ibid). They have worked to make visible the unique climate and environmental challenges faced by Afrodescendant communities, promoting their expertise and perspectives in decision-making processes (ibid). Research and Community Innovation: The forum supports on-the-ground resources for Afro-descendant communities to engage in research and community innovation projects. This includes documenting best practices and successful cases in natural climate solutions (ESI 2022). They have created regional hubs to incubate and accelerate community-based green business initiatives, fostering local solutions to climate challenges (ibid). The AIFCC collaborates with the MIT ESI to conduct research and strengthen the technical capacities of Afro-descendant populations. This partnership aims to address the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss (AIFCC, Promoting the expertise and perspectives of Afro-descendant communities in the Americas in climate change decision-making, conservation.org). They have hosted events and discussions to high list the needs and roles of Afro-descendant communities in environmental stewardship and climate action (Ibid).",
